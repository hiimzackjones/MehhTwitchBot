# MehhTwitchBot

Okay so. I'm looking to make a quick python script that connects to a twitch IRC chat and is able to push the chat through the terminal live. 

Additionally I'd like for it to log all output to a file or an object that can be used in other scripts later. 

Feel free to pull this down and mess around with it. If you see a better way to get what I'm looking to do acomplished let me know or just go for it.
