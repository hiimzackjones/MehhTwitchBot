# MehhTwitchBot

Okay so. I'm looking to make a quick python script that connects to a twitch IRC chat and is able to push the chat through the terminal live. 

Additionally I'd like for it to log all output to a file or an object that can be used in other scripts later. I've placed a second python script that does just that. 
Feel free to pull this down and mess around with it. If you see a better way to get what I'm looking to do acomplished let me know or just go for it. 


## How to use
You will have to change the 'nickname' or 'username' to match yours and in the channel section make sure it says whatever channel you'd like to test it on. Feel free to use the #mehhsecurity channel. 

Of course, to authenticate you'll need your oauth as well. Twitch supplies this. https://twitchapps.com/tmi

Okay good luck!
